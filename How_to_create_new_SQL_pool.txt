How to create new SQL pool in Synapse Analytics workspace and allow user authorization via Azure Active Directory

STEP 1. Create new SQL pool
   - login to Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com/
   - go to Synapse Analytics service page
   - in the list of Synapse Workspaces click on the one you want to add new SQL pool to
   - click on the button "+ New dedicated SQL pool"
   - Enter Dedicated SQL pool name and choose Performance level
   - opionally configure other additional settings and tags
   - click "Review and create"
   - check that your inputs are correct and click "Create"

 The process may take a few minutes. Once it is complete, you will get a notification that recource has been created successfully.

 STEP2. Create DB user for your admin account and grant permissions
    - login to your new created database 
        use following connection parameters:
        - server name: 
        - authentication: using Azure Active Directory (with MFA - if required)
        - user name: your Azure account
        - database: the name of the new SQL pool you created in Step 1
        NOTE: your account must be a member of corresponding SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER Group, e.g. "GP_DEV_SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER"
    
    - execute following TSQL commands:

    CREATE USER [GP_DEV_SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
    -- if logged in to target DB
    GRANT CONTROL TO GP_DEV_SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER;
    -- if logged in to master DB
    GRANT CONTROL ON DATABASE::SQLPOOL_TEST29_1 TO GP_DEV_SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER;

STEP3. Manage user access to your new database
    What you can do: everything as with regular MS SQL database
    - add new users 
    - delete users
    - add user groups
    - delete user groups
    grant permisions to users or groups
    revoke permissions

    CREATE USER [GP_DEV_SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
    GRANT CONTROL ON DATABASE::SQLPOOL_TEST29_1 TO GP_DEV_SYNAPSE_SERVER_MANAGER;



STEP X. Delete SQL pool
    Everything will be deleted - entire database, sql pool resource, all permissions.
